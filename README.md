This is my work from the past weekend.
Separate from the trivia project(because of falling behind on that) I built this template for managing user authentication and authorization.

- This work template uses cookies to save the users info on there computer and make the app state full.
- This system automatically tries to validate the user on the moment of arriving to the home page.
- I attempted to make sure that that a minimum amount of requests be sent from the client side to the server side if those are not necessary.
For example Token refresh happens immediate with every request to the server.
